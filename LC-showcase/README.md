In order to run the full Live Coaches Demo with Ross's BDD system hosted somewhere else, try this:

1. Load up the SM_rando_master folder
2. Run the route_server.py file under notebooks/route_server.py. This will run on localhost:8008
3. Load up localhost:8008/docs to see the system running on the webpage, does not need to be opened for it to work
4. Load up the single-player.html file inside the Live Coaches folder under LC-showcase
5. Run the local host or GitHub page for it to work
6. To try and check if the system is working, try to trigger the coach to run the function call "get_next_step_to_beat_game" by asking it literally.
7. If done successfully, you should see some function calls being performed in order to retrieve the ROM data and calculate where the player is related to the game state.
